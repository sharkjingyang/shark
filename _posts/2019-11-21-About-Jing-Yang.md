## Introduction
I am Jing Yang ( 荆洋 ) , a PhD student majoring in Applied Mathematics in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I got my Bachelor's Degree in SJTU in 2020. I was a member of [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), which is an elite mathematics program in SJTU for top 5% talented students.

My current research field :
* Deep generative models
* Optimization
